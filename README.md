Want to add a service for headspace? Give yourself access to one of our
servers? Set it up with salt!

Salt is a system for declaring server configuration. It's pretty awesome as it
means we can rebuild  or add servers without much effort.

Any services added that are not part of this repo have a less than zero
probability of remaining working if a server decides to asplode.
